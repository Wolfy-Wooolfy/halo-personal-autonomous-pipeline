# Cognitive Artifacts Definition Specification

**Document ID:** HALO-DOC-16  
**Status:** BINDING – ARTIFACT SCHEMA AUTHORITY  
**Scope:** Stage A, B, C, D Cognitive Artifacts  
**Enforcement:** Fail-Closed  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory artifact types
produced by the Cognitive Lifecycle.

It establishes:

- Artifact names
- Required locations
- Authority classification
- Closure eligibility
- Cross-stage binding rules

Artifacts defined here are execution-bound.
If an artifact does not comply with this document:
→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

---

## 2. Artifact Authority Model

Artifacts are classified into:

1. Candidate Artifacts (no authority)
2. Closure Artifacts (stage authority)
3. Verification Artifacts (gating authority)
4. Audit Artifacts (boundary authority)
5. Acceptance Artifacts (final authority)

No artifact may exceed its classification.

---

# STAGE A ARTIFACTS

---

## A1 — idea_evaluation_report.md

Path:
artifacts/stage_A/idea_evaluation_report.md

Type:
Candidate → becomes authoritative only after Approval Gate.

Purpose:
Structured evaluation of raw idea.

Mandatory Sections:
- Problem Definition
- Scope Definition
- Risk Surface
- Feasibility Assessment
- Constraints
- Explicit Assumptions (if any)

Narrative allowed:
YES (non-authoritative until closure)

---

## A2 — idea_final_spec.md

Path:
artifacts/stage_A/idea_final_spec.md

Type:
Authoritative (after approval)

Purpose:
Canonical, frozen definition of idea.

Mandatory Content:
- Goals
- Non-goals
- Success Criteria
- Constraints
- Interfaces (if applicable)
- Assumption Zero Rule declaration

This artifact becomes Stage B input authority.

---

## A3 — stage_A_closure.json

Path:
artifacts/stage_A/stage_A_closure.json

Type:
Closure Artifact

Mandatory Fields:
- timestamp_utc
- stage = "A"
- idea_final_spec_path
- approval_status ("APPROVED")
- iteration_count
- authority_hash

Without this artifact → Stage A not closed.

---

# STAGE B ARTIFACTS

---

## B1 — documentation_pack/

Path:
artifacts/stage_B/documentation_pack/

Type:
Authoritative Document Set

Must include:
- All required system docs
- No placeholders
- No TODO markers
- No unresolved cross-references

---

## B2 — gap_analysis_report.json

Path:
artifacts/stage_B/gap_analysis_report.json

Type:
Verification-bound artifact

Mandatory Fields:
- timestamp_utc
- total_docs_scanned
- coverage_map
- gaps_detected (integer)
- unresolved_references
- result ("PASS" | "FAIL")

Stage B closure requires:
gaps_detected = 0

---

## B3 — stage_B_closure.json

Path:
artifacts/stage_B/stage_B_closure.json

Type:
Closure Artifact

Mandatory Fields:
- timestamp_utc
- stage = "B"
- documentation_pack_hash
- gap_analysis_report_path
- result ("CLOSED")
- iteration_count

Without zero gaps → closure forbidden.

---

# STAGE C ARTIFACTS

---

## C1 — code_trace_matrix.md

Path:
artifacts/stage_C/code_trace_matrix.md

Purpose:
Maps documentation elements → code units.

Must include:
- Doc reference ID
- Code file path
- Function/class mapping
- Coverage status

No uncovered spec allowed.

---

## C2 — code_mismatch_report.json

Path:
artifacts/stage_C/code_mismatch_report.json

Mandatory Fields:
- timestamp_utc
- mismatches_detected
- mismatch_list
- result ("PASS" | "FAIL")

Closure requires:
mismatches_detected = 0

---

## C3 — test_evidence.md

Path:
artifacts/stage_C/test_evidence.md

Must reference:
- verify/unit/verification_report.json
- local_command_log.jsonl entries
- stdout/stderr file paths

No narrative claims allowed.

---

## C4 — stage_C_closure.json

Path:
artifacts/stage_C/stage_C_closure.json

Mandatory Fields:
- timestamp_utc
- stage = "C"
- trace_matrix_hash
- mismatch_report_path
- verification_report_path
- result ("CLOSED")

Closure forbidden if:
- Any mismatch
- Verification FAIL
- Missing evidence

---

# STAGE D ARTIFACTS

---

## D1 — final_acceptance_report.json

Path:
artifacts/stage_D/final_acceptance_report.json

Mandatory Fields:
- timestamp_utc
- lifecycle_id
- verification_reference
- audit_status
- result ("ACCEPTED" | "REJECTED")

No narrative explanation allowed.

---

## D2 — release_gate_closure.md

Path:
artifacts/stage_D/release_gate_closure.md

Exists ONLY if:
final_acceptance_report.result = "ACCEPTED"

Must reference:
- All stage closure artifacts
- Verification references
- Audit log references

---

# 3. Cross-Artifact Binding Rules

- Stage B cannot begin without stage_A_closure.json
- Stage C cannot begin without stage_B_closure.json
- Stage D cannot begin without stage_C_closure.json
- Acceptance cannot occur without all closure artifacts present

---

# 4. Artifact Hash Rule

All closure artifacts MUST include:
authority_hash

authority_hash is SHA256 of:
- All authoritative inputs
- All referenced artifacts

Hash mismatch → FAIL CLOSED.

---

# 5. Artifact Immutability Rule

Closure artifacts:
- Immutable once written
- Cannot be edited
- Only invalidated via stage re-entry

Candidate artifacts:
- May iterate
- Must track iteration_count

---

# 6. Prohibited Artifact Behavior

Artifacts MUST NOT:
- Advance stage implicitly
- Modify progress directly
- Override verification
- Override audit
- Carry narrative authority

Any violation → SYSTEM FAILURE.

---

# 7. Definition of Artifact Integrity

Artifact integrity exists when:

- Correct path
- Correct schema
- Deterministic fields
- No null mandatory fields
- Correct hash
- Correct stage reference

If integrity cannot be proven:
→ Execution MUST FAIL CLOSED.

---

# 8. Deterministic Authority Separation

Cognitive Layer:
Produces artifacts.

Pipeline:
Grants stage authority.

Verification:
Grants compliance gate.

Audit:
Grants permission gate.

Stage D:
Grants acceptance authority.

No layer may assume another’s authority.
