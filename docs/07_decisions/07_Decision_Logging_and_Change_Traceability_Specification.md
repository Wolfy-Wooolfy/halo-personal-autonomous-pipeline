# 📘 Decision Logging & Change Traceability Specification

**System:** Personal Autonomous Pipeline for HALO  
**Document Type:** Governance / Audit / Control  
**Status:** BINDING (Governance Core)  
**Applies To:** All pipeline stages (A → D)  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines a **mandatory, deterministic system** for:

- Logging all decisions taken by the pipeline
- Tracing every decision to:
  - The triggering artifact
  - The resulting change
- Enabling full audit, rollback, and accountability
- Preventing silent or undocumented behavior

This system exists to ensure that **nothing changes without a reason, and nothing happens without a trace**.

---

### 1.1 Decision Is Fork Resolution Only (Hard)

A Decision exists for ONE purpose only:
to resolve a selectable execution fork.

A Decision MUST NOT:
- Justify outcomes
- Explain failures
- Document reasoning
- Improve clarity retroactively
- Validate correctness

If no selectable fork exists,
a Decision MUST NOT be created.

Decision logs are control artifacts,
not narrative records.

---

## 2. What Qualifies as a Decision

A Decision is a **human-authoritative, execution-binding act**
that selects ONE option
among multiple valid, contract-compliant alternatives.

A Decision MUST:
- Be human-issued
- Resolve a real execution fork
- Select exactly ONE option
- Have irreversible downstream impact
- Be required to unblock execution

A Decision MUST NOT:
- Explain rationale or background
- Justify correctness
- Summarize context
- Describe implementation details
- Replace validation, verification, or enforcement

If execution does NOT require a choice
between multiple valid alternatives,
a Decision MUST NOT be logged.

---

## 2.1 Decision Authority Rule

Decision authority is strictly HUMAN.

Only a human may:
- Select an option among a valid execution fork
- Resolve ambiguity between multiple compliant paths

The pipeline orchestrator is authorized ONLY to:
- Capture the human decision
- Create the Decision artifact
- Assign the Decision ID
- Enforce decision binding on execution
- Track decision application status

Individual agents MAY:
- Detect execution forks
- Propose candidate options
- Reference existing Decision IDs

Agents MUST NOT:
- Select options
- Resolve forks
- Log decisions independently
- Continue execution past a fork without a logged Decision

Any human response has ZERO execution authority
until it is captured
as a Decision artifact
by the orchestrator.

Continuation without a Decision
after a fork is detected
is forbidden.

---

### 2.1.1 Decision Proposal vs Decision Existence (Hard Rule)

A proposed decision has ZERO authority.

A decision exists ONLY when:
- A Decision ID is assigned
- The decision file is created
- The decision status is explicitly set

Any reference to:
- “Decided”
- “Chosen”
- “Accepted”
- “Rejected”

without an existing Decision artifact
is invalid and constitutes
a silent decision violation.

---

## 2.2 What Is NOT a Decision

The following are explicitly NOT Decisions:

- Execution Abort
- Validation failure
- Boundary enforcement
- Retry exhaustion
- Error handling
- Clarification of existing intent
- Explanation or justification of behavior
- Acceptance of a deterministically correct outcome

Logging any of the above
as a Decision
constitutes authority inflation
and is a system violation.

---

## 3. What Counts as a Decision

A Decision exists ONLY when a selectable execution fork exists.

A selectable execution fork exists ONLY if ALL of the following are true:

- More than one option is valid and contract-compliant
- Each option would produce materially different downstream artifacts or behavior
- The pipeline cannot proceed deterministically without choosing exactly one option
- The choice is required to unblock execution

If these conditions are not met:
- The action MUST proceed deterministically under existing contracts
- NO Decision MUST be logged

Examples of cases that MAY be Decisions ONLY IF they form a real selectable fork:

- Selecting one approach among multiple valid approaches
- Accepting one assumption vs rejecting it (when both are valid paths)
- Skipping a step ONLY if skipping is contract-allowed and alternatives exist
- Initiating rollback ONLY if multiple rollback paths exist
- Choosing to take no action ONLY if action is optional and multiple valid paths exist

The mere fact that something "could have been done differently"
does NOT qualify as a Decision.

Only selectable, execution-unblocking forks qualify.

---

### 3.1 Decision Content Minimality Rule (Hard)

A Decision file MUST contain ONLY the minimum information
required to resolve a selectable execution fork.

Mandatory fields:
- Decision ID
- Fork description
- Available options
- Selected option
- Immediate execution effect

A Decision file MUST NOT contain:
- Background context
- Narrative explanation
- Analysis or reasoning
- Risk discussion
- Quality evaluation
- Historical justification

Decision logs are execution control artifacts,
not documentation,
not analysis,
and not explanation.

If justification, reasoning, or context
is required for understanding,
it belongs in documentation,
NOT in a Decision file.

---

### 3.2 Execution Abort Is NOT a Decision (Hard Rule)

Execution Abort MUST NOT be logged as a Decision.

If execution terminates because:
- No valid execution path exists
- No selectable alternative is available
- Boundaries are enforced without choice

Then:
- No Decision MUST be created
- No Decision ID MUST be assigned
- The termination MUST be logged as an Abort event only

Logging an Abort as a Decision
without an execution fork
is a contract violation.

---

### 3.3 Decision Is NOT Approval (Hard Rule)

A Decision does NOT:
- Approve quality
- Confirm correctness
- Validate implementation
- Certify success

A Decision ONLY:
- Resolves a selectable execution fork

Verification and validation
remain the sole authority
of Stage D (Verification).

A verified, correct, or successful outcome
that was reached deterministically
MUST NOT produce a Decision.

Using Decisions as approval signals
is strictly forbidden.

---

## 4. Decision Types

Each decision MUST be classified as one of the following:

- **ARCH** — Architectural
- **SCOPE** — Scope inclusion / exclusion
- **EXEC** — Execution strategy
- **DATA** — Data structure or schema
- **RISK** — Accepted risk
- **FIX** — Bug fix or correction
- **ROLLBACK** — Reversion or undo

A Decision MUST NOT be amended,
extended,
or reinterpreted after issuance.

If new circumstances arise
that require a different outcome:

- A NEW Decision MUST be logged
- The original Decision remains immutable
- Execution MUST reference both Decisions explicitly

Silent correction,
reinterpretation,
or retroactive adjustment
of a Decision
is strictly forbidden.

---

## 5. Decision Log Structure

All decisions are stored under:

```

decisions/

```

Each decision is a **single immutable Markdown file**.

### File Naming Convention

```

DEC-YYYYMMDD-XXX.md

```

Example:
```

DEC-20260206-004.md

```

---

### 5.1 Decision Finality Rule (Hard)

A Decision file is immutable.

- Once logged, it MUST NOT be edited
- It MUST NOT be reinterpreted
- It MUST NOT be overridden implicitly

Decision lifecycle rules:
- A newly captured fork resolution MUST be logged with `Status: OPEN`
- After the selected option is applied and all decision-bound effects are completed:
  - The Decision MUST transition to `Status: CLOSED`
- If a different outcome is required later:
  - A NEW Decision MUST be logged
  - The new Decision MUST set `Status: SUPERSEDED` and reference the old Decision explicitly

Silent decision reversal,
silent edits,
or retroactive adjustment
are system violations.

---

## 6. Mandatory Decision File Schema

Every decision file MUST follow this exact structure.

This schema is intentionally MINIMAL.

It contains ONLY the information required
to resolve a selectable execution fork.

No narrative sections are permitted.

```md
# Decision: <Short Title>

**Decision ID:** DEC-YYYYMMDD-XXX  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Stage:** A | B | C | D  
**Type:** ARCH | SCOPE | EXEC | DATA | RISK | FIX | ROLLBACK  
**Status:** OPEN | ACCEPTED | REJECTED | SUPERSEDED | CLOSED  

---

## Fork

A single factual statement describing:
- What execution fork exists
- What makes multiple options valid

---

## Options

A) <Option A>  
B) <Option B>  
C) <Option C>  

Rules:
- All options MUST be valid and contract-compliant
- Options MUST be mutually exclusive
- Options MUST be execution-unblocking

---

## Selected Option

<Exactly ONE: A | B | C>

---

## Immediate Execution Effect

A single factual statement describing
what MUST change immediately
as a direct result of the selected option.

---

## Triggering Artifact

The exact artifact (or failure output)
that exposed the fork.

Example:
- docs/03_pipeline/...
- verify/unit/...
- progress/status.json

---

## Affected Artifacts

List all impacted items (paths only):

- docs/...
- code/...
- verify/...
- configs/...

---

## Linked Changes

Links to:
- Commits
- PRs
- Generated artifacts
- Tests

No additional sections are allowed.

If any additional section exists
(e.g., Context, Rationale, Consequences, Risk, Justification):

- The Decision file is INVALID
- Execution MUST halt
- The Decision MUST be regenerated

---

## 7. Change Traceability Rules

1. **Decision-Bound Changes MUST Reference a Decision**

   Any change that originates from
   a human-authoritative execution fork
   MUST reference a Decision ID.

   Rule-driven, deterministic changes
   that are fully mandated by existing contracts
   MUST NOT be associated with a Decision.

2. **Bidirectional Trace (When a Decision Exists)**

   When a Decision exists:

   - Decision → MUST list all affected artifacts
   - Affected artifacts or commit messages → MUST reference the Decision ID

3. **One Primary Decision per Change Set**

   - Multiple artifacts MAY map to one Decision
   - One change set MUST NOT map to multiple Decisions

4. **Prohibition of Artificial Decision Coupling (Hard Rule)**

   The pipeline MUST NOT:
   - Invent Decisions to justify mandatory changes
   - Attach Decision IDs to forced or deterministic behavior
   - Inflate decision count for traceability convenience

   Changes that do not originate from a selectable execution fork
   MUST proceed WITHOUT decision logging.

Decision traceability exists to control authority,
not to narrate execution.

---

## 7.1 Decision-to-Stage Exit Binding (Hard Rule)

A pipeline stage MUST NOT close if:

- A required Decision is not logged
- A logged Decision is still OPEN
- A Decision's effects are not fully applied

Conversely:

- No Decision may be logged
  without being bound to a specific stage

Decision logging and stage exit
are atomically coupled.

Breaking this coupling
is a system violation.

---

## 8. Decision Finality & Supersession

Decisions are immutable once ACCEPTED.

They may NEVER be edited, reworded,
or partially modified.

If a decision must be changed:
- A new Decision MUST be created
- The new Decision MUST explicitly SUPERSEDE the old one
- The old Decision remains permanently valid for its time

A decision is considered CLOSED when:
- Its effects are fully applied
- Its affected artifacts are closed
- No pending actions remain

An OPEN decision MUST block
stage completion.

---

## 8.1 Decision Block (Execution Halt State)

A Decision Block is NOT an execution fork.
It is NOT a Human Interrupt.
It is a deterministic enforcement state that occurs when:

- A Decision artifact exists, AND
- The Decision status is ACCEPTED, AND
- One or more Decision effects are not yet fully applied

In a Decision Block:

- Execution MUST be BLOCKED (per the Progress Tracking Contract)
- No stage may close
- No downstream stage may start
- Progress MUST remain unchanged

During a Decision Block:

- `blocking_questions` MUST contain exactly ONE structural blocking entry that is NOT an option fork and requires no preference:
  - "Decision effects pending application. Mandatory apply required to resume execution."
- `next_step` MUST be an empty string

Resolution:

- The orchestrator MUST apply the Decision effects deterministically
- Execution may resume ONLY after:
  - All Decision effects are fully applied, AND
  - All affected artifacts are closed and validated

A Decision Block is not a failure.
It is an authority-bound enforcement halt.

---

## 9. Rollback Enforcement

If a decision is marked for rollback:

* A new **ROLLBACK** decision is created
* The rollback decision MUST reference:

  * Original Decision ID
  * Reason for rollback
* Rollback execution MUST be logged as well

---

## 10. Audit & Verification

At any time, the system must be able to deterministically answer the following audit questions
using ONLY authoritative artifacts (no narrative interpretation):

* Why does this behavior exist?
  - Answered by: `Fork` + `Immediate Execution Effect` + `Triggering Artifact` + `Linked Changes`
* Who/what approved it?
  - Answered by: Decision ID + Decision file presence under `/decisions`
* What alternatives were rejected?
  - Answered by: the `Options` list inside the Decision file
* How do we undo it?
  - Answered by: a `ROLLBACK` Decision that references the original Decision ID,
    and lists the explicit rollback targets under `Affected Artifacts`

If any answer cannot be derived deterministically from authoritative artifacts:
- The system is considered NON-COMPLIANT
- Execution MUST halt
- Human escalation is REQUIRED

---

## 11. Pipeline Gate Enforcement

No pipeline stage may pass its exit gate unless:

* Any REQUIRED Decision forks encountered in that stage are resolved by:
  - a logged Decision artifact (if and only if a selectable fork existed), AND
  - full application of the Decision effects (no Decision Block remaining)

* Any Decision-bound change set produced in that stage is traceable to exactly one Decision ID
  using the bidirectional trace rules in Section 7

Rule-driven, deterministic changes that are fully mandated by existing contracts:
- MUST proceed WITHOUT a Decision
- MUST NOT be artificially coupled to a Decision ID

Failure to satisfy these gate rules = HARD STOP.

---

## 11.1 Decision Minimality Rule

Decisions MUST represent meaningful forks
in execution or authority.

The pipeline MUST NOT:
- Log stylistic or trivial choices
- Fragment a single logical decision into multiples
- Inflate decision count for coverage

Decision logs exist for control, not verbosity.

---

## 11.1.1 Decision Inflation Guard (Hard Constraint)

The pipeline MUST actively prevent
artificial inflation of decisions.

A decision MUST NOT be logged if:
- It exists only to justify an already forced rule
- It documents an obvious or mandatory action
- It does not introduce a real execution fork

If multiple decisions are logged
without closing artifacts or advancing stages:
- Execution MUST halt
- The condition MUST be logged as a system fault
- Human escalation is REQUIRED

Decisions exist to resolve forks,
not to narrate execution.

---

### 11.2 Decision Worthiness Gate (Mandatory)

Before logging any decision, the pipeline MUST verify
that the decision meets ALL of the following criteria:

- The execution could not continue deterministically
  without selecting one option over another
- The decision has a structural, behavioral, or authority impact
- The decision outcome cannot be trivially derived from an existing rule
- Reversing the decision would meaningfully alter execution or artifacts

If ALL criteria are not met:
- The action MUST proceed without decision logging
- The behavior is considered rule-driven, not decision-driven

Logging low-impact or mechanical choices
as decisions
is a contract violation.

---

## 11.3 Decision Saturation Guard

The pipeline MUST actively prevent
decision saturation.

If multiple consecutive decisions are logged
without advancing artifacts or stages:

- Execution MUST pause
- The condition MUST be flagged as a system fault
- Human escalation is REQUIRED

Decisions exist to resolve forks,
not to replace deterministic execution.

---

### 11.4 Decision Density Constraint (Hard)

The pipeline MUST enforce
a bounded decision density.

If more than one decision is logged
without closing at least one artifact
or advancing a stage:

- Execution MUST halt
- The condition MUST be logged as a system fault
- Human escalation is REQUIRED

Decisions exist to unlock execution,
not to replace it.

---

## 12. Summary

This document ensures that the system:

- Is auditable
- Is reversible
- Does not drift
- Does not improvise authority

Core rules:
- No selectable fork → No Decision
- Selectable fork → Decision REQUIRED (human-authoritative)
- Rule-driven deterministic changes → NO Decision (but MUST remain traceable through artifacts, gates, and linked changes)

Nothing may change silently.
Nothing may proceed without a trace.
