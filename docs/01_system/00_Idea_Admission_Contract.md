# Idea Structuring & Admission Layer Contract

**Document ID:** DOC-00  
**Status:** FINAL — PRE-STAGE GOVERNANCE  
**Scope:** Idea Maturation Before Stage A  
**Applies To:** All Projects Entering the Autonomous Project Engine  
**Enforcement Level:** Soft-Governed, Non-Executable

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the structured incubation layer that exists
before Stage A (Contract Formalization).

Its purpose is to:

- Prevent premature formalization
- Allow iterative idea refinement
- Validate project viability before entering the deterministic pipeline
- Ensure Stage A only receives mature, contract-ready ideas

This layer is NOT part of the executable pipeline.

It is a governance boundary.

---

## 2. Position in System Architecture

System flow becomes:

Idea → Idea Structuring Layer → Stage A → Stage B → Stage C → Stage D

The Idea Structuring Layer exists outside stage governance
and produces exactly one output:

An Admission-Ready Project Definition.

---

## 3. What This Layer Does

This layer:

- Clarifies problem statement
- Defines intended outcome
- Identifies primary user or beneficiary
- Defines measurable success condition
- Detects ambiguity or structural weakness
- Allows unlimited revision before admission

This layer does NOT:

- Generate executable artifacts
- Open stages
- Create progress entries
- Produce closure artifacts

---

## 4. Admission Criteria (Mandatory Before Stage A)

A project may enter Stage A only if:

1. Problem statement is precise.
2. End-state outcome is defined.
3. Success condition is measurable.
4. Project boundary is defined.
5. Deterministic artifact output is possible.

If any criterion fails:
Project remains in Idea Structuring Layer.

---

## 5. Output Artifact

The only allowed output is:

`artifacts/admission/project_admission_definition.md`

This document must include:

- Project Name
- Problem Definition
- Intended Final State
- Success Metrics
- Scope Boundaries
- Initial Risk Assessment

Only after this document exists
may Stage A initialize.

---

## 6. Non-Deterministic Freedom Zone

Within this layer:

- Ideas may evolve
- Scope may change
- Concepts may merge or split
- Cancellation is allowed
- Redirection is allowed

No fail-closed enforcement applies here.

Deterministic enforcement begins at Stage A.

---

## 7. Governance Boundary

This layer prevents:

- Over-formalization
- Premature contract freeze
- Artificial stage inflation
- False progress tracking

It ensures the engine remains
a Project Forge, not a bureaucracy.
