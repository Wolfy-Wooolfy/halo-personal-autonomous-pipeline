# Vision & Cognitive Layer Reference (v1)

**Status:** REFERENCE — NON-EXECUTABLE (Vision Baseline)  
**Applies To:** Forge (Forge)  
**Owner:** Human Authority (Khaled)  
**Enforcement:** None (This document is NOT an execution contract)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **vision baseline** for what the project is ultimately intended to become.

It exists to:
- Provide a stable “north star” reference
- Enable deterministic gap checks between:
  - the intended end-state, and
  - the currently binding execution contracts under `/docs/`

This document has **ZERO direct execution authority**.

If any behavior is desired, it must be expressed explicitly in:
- Pipeline Stages Specification (Doc-03)
- Autonomy Policy & Human Interrupt Protocol (Doc-04)
- Artifact Schema & Repository Layout Standard (Doc-05)
- Progress Tracking & Status Report Contract (Doc-06)
- Decision Logging & Change Traceability Spec (Doc-07)
- HALO Boundary Audit Rules (Doc-08)
- Build & Verify Playbook (Doc-09)
- Runtime Setup & Assumptions (Doc-10)

No downstream stage may treat this document as an executable rule source.

## 2. The Target System (End-State)

The target system is a **strict, fail-closed, contract-driven autonomous pipeline** that can run for hours/days without human intervention while making **zero silent assumptions**.

The system must reliably transform:

1) An idea / request  
→ into a validated and approval-bound final spec

2) A final spec  
→ into a complete deterministic documentation pack (with gap detection and refinement loops)

3) A documentation pack  
→ into compliant code and verification evidence (with traceability and mismatch enforcement)

---

## 3. What Exists Today vs What Must Be Added

### 3.1 What exists today (Pipeline Engine)

The current codebase primarily provides:
- Strict stage governance A/B/C/D
- Fail-Closed execution discipline
- Artifact-based progress tracking
- Idempotency / bounded execution steps
- Status-as-truth (`progress/status.json`)
- Task handler registry + deterministic task execution contract

This is a discipline and governance engine.

### 3.2 What must be added (Cognitive Layer)

To reach the target end-state, the pipeline must be extended by a “Cognitive Layer” implemented as:
- Deterministic task types
- Deterministic validators
- Deterministic artifact schemas

The Cognitive Layer must provide these missing capabilities:

- Idea finalization loop (A)
- Documentation gap detection + refinement loop (B)
- Code ↔ Docs trace & mismatch enforcement loop (C)
- Verification evidence binding (C/D)

This layer must remain strictly bounded by:
- explicit contracts
- deterministic gates
- non-executable candidate outputs

---

## 4. The 3 Required Intelligence Loops

### 4.1 Loop A — Idea Finalization (Stage A)

Goal:
- Convert raw intent into a frozen “Idea Final Spec”
- Produce an evaluation artifact
- Produce a mandatory human approval record (only here)

Outputs must be artifacts, not chat conclusions.

Key property:
- Approval gate is a hard stop prior to Stage B initiation.

---

### 4.2 Loop B — Docs Pack + Gap Analyzer + Refinement (Stage B)

Goal:
- Generate all required specs as a “Docs Pack”
- Run deterministic gap detection across the pack
- If gaps exist:
  - iterate refinement deterministically
  - until MUST-level gaps = 0
  - or return upstream / interrupt per policy

Key property:
- Stage C must never “fill missing behavior.”
- Underspecification is a Stage B failure, not a Stage C opportunity.

---

### 4.3 Loop C — Code Compliance + Traceability + Verification Evidence (Stage C)

Goal:
- Generate/modify code strictly from the Docs Pack
- Produce a deterministic docs→code trace matrix
- Produce a mismatch report:
  - missing required behavior
  - undocumented behavior
  - interface/schema mismatches
- Produce test evidence artifacts per the playbook

Key property:
- Unmapped code is forbidden.
- If any behavior cannot be traced to a spec clause, execution must return to Stage B.

---

## 5. Non-Negotiable Principles (Vision-Level)

- Fail-Closed by default
- No silent assumptions
- No discretionary autonomy
- No authority derived from narrative documents
- Candidate outputs have zero authority
- Status-as-truth via `progress/status.json`
- Immutable closed artifacts
- Boundary Audit supremacy over all other checks
- Verification evidence must be artifact-bound, replayable, and logged

---

## 6. How This Vision Is Used

This document is used only to:
- Create a deterministic “Vision → Contracts” coverage map
- Identify what contract clauses and artifact schemas are missing
- Drive new contract documents or contract amendments

This document MUST NOT:
- grant authority
- introduce runtime rules
- change execution behavior directly

---

## 7. Definition of “Vision Alignment”

The system is considered aligned with this vision when:
- The three loops (A/B/C) are implemented via explicit contracts
- Each loop has deterministic termination criteria
- Every loop produces schema-bound, reviewable artifacts
- Stage transitions are blocked unless gates pass
- No missing capability requires “chat judgment” to proceed
