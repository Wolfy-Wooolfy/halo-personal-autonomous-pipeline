# TRACE_ENGINE_CONTRACT_v1

Document ID: DOC-32  
Status: EXECUTION-BOUND  
Authority Level: HARD (Fail-Closed)  
Applies To: SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM  
Governed By: MODULE_ORCHESTRATION_GOVERNANCE_v1  

---

# 1. Purpose

The Trace Module establishes deterministic traceability between:

- Governance Documents
- Functional Requirements
- Code Units
- Execution Artifacts

Trace ensures:

- No undocumented code exists
- No unimplemented requirement exists
- No orphan artifact exists
- Full structural traceability is maintained

Trace does NOT fix gaps.
Trace only detects mapping integrity.

---

# 2. Activation Preconditions

Trace may execute ONLY IF:

- Intake completed successfully
- Audit completed successfully
- audit_findings.blocked == false
- intake_snapshot.locked_snapshot_flag == true

If any condition fails → halt immediately.

---

# 3. Trace Scope

Trace MUST build mappings across three axes:

A) Document Requirements  
B) Code Units  
C) Produced Artifacts  

All mappings must be deterministic and rule-based.

---

# 4. Requirement Extraction Rules

Trace MUST extract requirement units from:

- docs/03_pipeline/*.md
- Any EXECUTION-BOUND governance document

Requirement Identification Rules:

- Headers beginning with "# " represent major requirement sections
- Headers beginning with "## " represent sub-requirements
- Any section labeled "Purpose", "Rules", "Law", "Contract", "Schema" qualifies as traceable unit
- Document ID must be captured

Each requirement must be assigned:

- requirement_id
- source_document
- section_path
- normalized_title

Extraction must be deterministic.
No NLP interpretation permitted.

---

# 5. Code Unit Identification Rules

Trace MUST scan:

code/src/

Code Unit Definition:

- Exported functions
- Module files
- Handler definitions
- Registry entries
- Execution entrypoints
- Stage transition logic

Each Code Unit must include:

- unit_id
- file_path
- exported_symbol
- detected_role (heuristic classification allowed but deterministic)

No runtime execution permitted during scan.

---

# 6. Artifact Reference Mapping

Trace MUST detect:

- Artifacts referenced in documents
- Artifacts produced by modules
- Artifacts referenced in code

Artifacts MUST be cross-linked by path.

If document references artifact path that does not exist → flag.

---

# 7. Trace Matrix Construction

Trace MUST generate:

artifacts/trace/trace_matrix.json  
artifacts/trace/trace_matrix.md  

---

# 8. trace_matrix.json Schema

{
  "execution_id": "",
  "total_requirements": 0,
  "total_code_units": 0,
  "total_artifacts": 0,
  "mappings": [
    {
      "requirement_id": "",
      "document": "",
      "mapped_code_units": [],
      "mapped_artifacts": [],
      "coverage_status": ""
    }
  ],
  "orphan_code_units": [],
  "orphan_requirements": [],
  "orphan_artifacts": []
}

---

# 9. Coverage Status Rules

coverage_status may be:

- FULL
- PARTIAL
- NONE

Rules:

FULL:
- At least one code unit
- At least one artifact
- Deterministic linkage exists

PARTIAL:
- Code exists but no artifact evidence
OR
- Artifact exists but no code linkage

NONE:
- Requirement not linked to any code

---

# 10. Orphan Detection Rules

Trace MUST identify:

Orphan Code Unit:
- Code without document linkage

Orphan Requirement:
- Documented requirement with no code

Orphan Artifact:
- Artifact not referenced by document nor code

All orphans must be explicitly listed.

---

# 11. Determinism Rules

Trace MUST:

- Sort requirements lexicographically by document path then section order
- Sort code units lexicographically by file path
- Sort artifacts lexicographically by path
- Use stable ID generation (hash of path + title)

No randomness permitted.

---

# 12. Fail-Closed Conditions

Trace MUST halt if:

- Required governance document unreadable
- code/src/ inaccessible
- Artifact namespace corrupted
- Duplicate requirement_id detected
- Duplicate unit_id detected

Upon halt:

- artifacts/trace/trace_error.md must be generated
- System enters BLOCKED
- Exactly ONE blocking question must be produced

---

# 13. Downstream Invalidation Rule

If Trace re-runs:

Invalidate:

- gap/
- decisions/
- backfill/
- execute/
- closure/

Audit and Intake remain valid unless structural change detected.

---

# 14. Trace Completion Criteria

Trace is COMPLETE only when:

- trace_matrix.json exists
- trace_matrix.md exists
- No fatal structural error
- Orphan lists explicitly generated
- Coverage status computed for all requirements

Only then may Gap module execute.

---

# 15. Trace Integrity Statement

Trace is the backbone of SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM.

Without traceability:

- No enforcement possible
- No gap detection possible
- No deterministic building possible

Trace must be complete before any corrective action begins.
