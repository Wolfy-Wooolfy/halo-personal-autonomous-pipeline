# AUDIT_ENGINE_CONTRACT_v1

Document ID: DOC-31  
Status: EXECUTION-BOUND  
Authority Level: HARD (Fail-Closed)  
Applies To: SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM  
Governed By: MODULE_ORCHESTRATION_GOVERNANCE_v1  

---

# 1. Purpose

The Audit Module validates structural, governance, and execution integrity
of the repository AFTER successful Intake.

Audit ensures:

- Mandatory governance documents exist
- Required directories exist
- progress/status.json is valid
- Artifact namespace rules are respected
- Naming authority rules are respected
- No structural drift exists

Audit does NOT evaluate business logic.
Audit evaluates structural compliance only.

---

# 2. Activation Preconditions

Audit may execute ONLY IF:

- artifacts/intake/intake_snapshot.json exists
- locked_snapshot_flag == true
- Intake completed successfully
- No BLOCKED state active

If any condition fails → halt immediately.

---

# 3. Audit Scope

Audit MUST validate the following layers:

A) Repository Structure  
B) Governance Documents  
C) Stage Integrity  
D) Artifact Namespace Integrity  
E) Status File Integrity  
F) Naming Authority Compliance  

All validations are deterministic and rule-based.

---

# 4. Repository Structure Validation

Mandatory directories:

- docs/
- artifacts/
- code/
- progress/

If FULL_PIPELINE_STATE classification was detected in Intake,
all above MUST exist.

If classification is lower tier,
validation rules adapt accordingly.

Structure validation must detect:

- Missing required directories
- Unexpected root-level folders
- Duplicate directory anomalies
- Illegal nested artifacts paths

---

# 5. Governance Document Validation

Mandatory documents:

- docs/03_pipeline/SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT_v1.md
- docs/03_pipeline/MODULE_ORCHESTRATION_GOVERNANCE_v1.md
- docs/03_pipeline/INTAKE_MODULE_CONTRACT_v1.md
- docs/03_pipeline/AUDIT_ENGINE_CONTRACT_v1.md

Audit MUST:

- Confirm file existence
- Confirm non-empty content
- Confirm correct filename casing
- Confirm no duplicate versions exist

Missing or malformed governance files → BLOCKED.

---

# 6. Stage Integrity Validation

Audit MUST validate:

- progress/status.json exists
- status_type is defined
- current_stage exists
- stage_progress_percent exists
- next_step exists

Rules:

- stage_progress_percent must be numeric
- must be between 0 and 100
- current_stage must match valid stage enum

If invalid → BLOCKED.

---

# 7. Artifact Namespace Integrity

Artifacts MUST only exist inside:

artifacts/<module_name>/

Allowed namespaces:

- intake
- audit
- trace
- gap
- decisions
- backfill
- execute
- closure
- release (if defined in governance)

Audit MUST detect:

- Artifacts written outside namespace
- Orphan artifacts
- Duplicate artifact filenames across modules
- Illegal nested artifact paths

Any violation → BLOCKED.

---

## 7.1 IMMUTABLE-LEGACY (GRANDFATHERED) Namespaces

The following artifact namespaces are permitted as IMMUTABLE-LEGACY:

- artifacts/tasks/
- artifacts/stage_A/
- artifacts/stage_B/
- artifacts/stage_C/
- artifacts/stage_D/
- artifacts/reports/
- artifacts/release/

Rules:

- These namespaces MAY exist for historical evidence only.
- They are READ-ONLY.
- Any new artifact written into IMMUTABLE-LEGACY is a CRITICAL violation and MUST halt execution.
- Audit MUST NOT fail solely due to the existence of IMMUTABLE-LEGACY namespaces.

---

# 8. Naming Authority Compliance

Audit MUST verify:

- No deprecated system names present
- No conflicting system identifiers
- Governance authority statements intact

Detection of deprecated name → BLOCKED.

---

# 9. Drift Detection Rules

Audit MUST detect:

- Governance doc modified without new execution cycle
- Closure artifacts modified post-closure
- Hash snapshot mismatch (if release manifest exists)
- Missing artifact referenced by other artifacts

Drift requires immediate halt.

---

# 10. Audit Artifacts (Mandatory)

Audit MUST generate:

1) artifacts/audit/audit_report.md  
2) artifacts/audit/audit_findings.json  

---

# 11. audit_findings.json Schema

Must contain:

{
  "execution_id": "",
  "total_checks": 0,
  "passed_checks": 0,
  "failed_checks": 0,
  "blocked": false,
  "violations": [
    {
      "category": "",
      "severity": "",
      "path": "",
      "description": ""
    }
  ]
}

---

# 12. Severity Levels

- INFO
- WARNING
- CRITICAL

If any CRITICAL violation exists → BLOCKED = true

---

# 13. Fail-Closed Conditions

Audit MUST halt if:

- Required governance document missing
- Stage corruption detected
- Artifact namespace violation detected
- Drift detected
- Integrity mismatch detected

Upon halt:

- artifacts/audit/audit_error.md MUST be generated
- System enters BLOCKED
- Exactly ONE blocking question must be produced

---

# 14. Downstream Invalidation Rule

If Audit re-runs:

Invalidate:

- trace/
- gap/
- decisions/
- backfill/
- execute/
- closure/

Intake artifacts remain valid unless Intake re-run triggered.

---

# 15. Completion Criteria

Audit is COMPLETE only when:

- audit_report.md exists
- audit_findings.json exists
- blocked == false
- No CRITICAL violations
- All mandatory checks executed

Only then may Trace module begin.
