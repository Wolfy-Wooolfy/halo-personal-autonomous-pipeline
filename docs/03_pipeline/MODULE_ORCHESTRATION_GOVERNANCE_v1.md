# 1. Authority & Scope

This document defines the authoritative governance model for executing
the SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM inside Forge.

This document:

- Defines module ordering
- Defines execution determinism
- Defines inter-module contracts
- Defines fail-closed behavior
- Defines decision escalation
- Defines immutability rules
- Defines runtime enforcement requirements

No module may execute outside this governance contract.

If conflict occurs between any module contract and this document,
THIS DOCUMENT PREVAILS.

# 2. Execution Determinism Law

Execution MUST be deterministic.

Given identical repository state:
- Same inputs
- Same file ordering
- Same configuration
- Same runtime version

The system MUST produce:
- Identical artifacts
- Identical reports
- Identical decisions
- Identical logs

Non-deterministic behaviors are strictly prohibited.

Examples of forbidden behavior:
- Random ordering
- Time-dependent logic without snapshot locking
- Non-seeded hashing
- External API calls without capture snapshot

---

# 3. Module Ordering Law

Modules MUST execute strictly in this order:

1. Intake
2. Audit
3. Trace
4. Gap
5. Decision Gate
6. Backfill
7. Execute
8. Closure

No module may skip forward.
No module may execute out of order.
No parallel execution is permitted.

---

# 4. Module Re-Entry Rule

A module may re-run only if:

- Repository state changed
- A Decision Gate approved re-entry
- A fail-closed state requires correction

Re-entry MUST invalidate downstream artifacts.

Example:
If Trace re-runs → Gap, Decision, Backfill, Execute, Closure must be invalidated.

---

# 5. Data Passing Contract

Each module MUST produce structured artifacts.

Artifacts are the ONLY allowed communication layer between modules.

Modules MAY NOT:
- Share in-memory state
- Depend on console logs
- Infer data outside artifacts

All artifacts MUST:

- Be schema-bound
- Be deterministic
- Be written before next module begins
- Be immutable once consumed downstream

---

# 6. Fail-Closed Law

If any ambiguity exists, the system MUST:

- Enter BLOCKED state
- Produce exactly ONE blocking question
- Halt execution

The system MUST NOT:
- Assume
- Infer missing intent
- Continue optimistically

BLOCKED state MUST be written into progress/status.json.

---

# 7. Decision Escalation Law

Decision Gate MUST activate when:

- Multiple valid corrective paths exist
- Architectural tradeoffs are detected
- Missing required authority input
- Risk of scope drift

Decision Packet MUST include:

- Context
- Options
- Risks
- Deterministic impact
- Required confirmation

Decision outcome MUST be logged immutably.

---

# 8. Stage Interaction Law

SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM operates INSIDE Forge.

It does NOT override stage governance.

If Stage contract conflicts with Module execution:

- Stage contract takes precedence
- System must escalate to Decision Gate

Stage transitions may occur only after Closure module success.

---

# 9. Emergency Halt Protocol

System MUST halt immediately if:

- Integrity verification fails
- Required artifact missing
- Status corruption detected
- Schema violation detected
- Runtime mismatch detected

Halt MUST produce:

- emergency_report.md
- explicit reason
- corrective recommendation

No silent recovery permitted.

---

# 10. Immutability & Drift Protection

Once Closure succeeds:

- All artifacts are immutable
- Hash snapshot must be regenerated
- Drift detection must be enabled

Any post-closure modification requires:

- Explicit new execution cycle
- New Decision record
- Artifact regeneration

---

# 11. Artifact Hierarchy Rule

Artifacts produced by modules MUST reside under:

artifacts/<module_name>/

Examples:

artifacts/intake/
artifacts/audit/
artifacts/trace/
artifacts/gap/
artifacts/decisions/
artifacts/backfill/
artifacts/execute/
artifacts/closure/

No module may write outside its designated namespace.

---

# 12. Runtime Enforcement Clause

Forge runtime MUST:

- Enforce module ordering
- Enforce artifact existence before progression
- Enforce fail-closed state
- Prevent stage drift
- Prevent re-run without invalidation

Runtime enforcement is mandatory.
Soft warnings are not permitted.

---

# 13. SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM Activation Condition

System activates when:

- progress/status.json indicates READY
- Or a new execution task is registered

Activation MUST:

- Lock repository snapshot
- Record execution start artifact
- Begin Intake module

---

# 14. Non-Compliance Consequence

If any module violates this governance:

- Execution is invalid
- Artifacts are considered corrupt
- Closure is forbidden
- System must halt

---

# 15. Governance Integrity Statement

This governance model ensures:

- Deterministic execution
- Zero silent drift
- Zero implicit assumption
- Full auditability
- Full traceability
- Reproducible builds

SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM is not a heuristic assistant.
It is a deterministic autonomous build engine.
