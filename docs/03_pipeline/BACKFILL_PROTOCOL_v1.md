# BACKFILL_PROTOCOL_v1

Document ID: DOC-35  
Status: EXECUTION-BOUND  
Authority Level: HARD (Fail-Closed)  
Applies To: SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM  
Governed By: MODULE_ORCHESTRATION_GOVERNANCE_v1  

---

# 1. Purpose

Backfill Module performs deterministic structural completion
BEFORE any code modification occurs.

It addresses:

- Missing documents
- Missing artifact directories
- Missing structural files
- Governance completeness gaps

Backfill DOES NOT modify existing code logic.
Backfill DOES NOT refactor.
Backfill DOES NOT optimize.

Backfill only creates what is explicitly authorized.

---

# 2. Activation Preconditions

Backfill may execute ONLY IF:

- Decision Gate completed
- BLOCKED state cleared
- gap_actions.json exists
- All selected actions are deterministic

If any condition fails → halt immediately.

---

# 3. Backfill Scope Definition

Backfill may act ONLY on gaps categorized as:

- UNIMPLEMENTED_REQUIREMENT (documentation-level)
- STRUCTURAL_DRIFT
- GOVERNANCE_MISMATCH
- ORPHAN_ARTIFACT (documentation reconciliation only)

Backfill MUST NOT act on:

- Code refactoring
- Code redesign
- Architectural transformation
- Performance optimization

Those belong to Execute Module.

---

# 4. Authorized Backfill Actions

Backfill may:

1) Create missing governance documents  
2) Create missing artifact directories  
3) Generate placeholder contract templates  
4) Generate missing schema files  
5) Generate deterministic stub documentation  
6) Normalize naming inconsistencies (if explicitly authorized)

Every action MUST originate from approved decision.

No spontaneous generation permitted.

---

# 5. Deterministic File Creation Rules

Backfill MUST:

- Create files with exact predefined naming
- Use predefined templates
- Avoid dynamic timestamps inside content
- Avoid non-deterministic metadata
- Avoid environment-dependent content

All file content must be reproducible.

---

# 6. Backfill Artifacts (Mandatory)

Backfill MUST generate:

1) artifacts/backfill/backfill_plan.json  
2) artifacts/backfill/backfill_execution_log.md  

If files created:

3) artifacts/backfill/backfill_created_files.json  

---

# 7. backfill_plan.json Schema

{
  "execution_id": "",
  "approved_actions": [
    {
      "action_id": "",
      "origin_gap_id": "",
      "target_path": "",
      "action_type": "",
      "deterministic_template_used": true
    }
  ]
}

---

# 8. File Creation Integrity Rules

For each created file:

System MUST:

- Verify file did not previously exist
- Verify path legality
- Verify namespace compliance
- Record checksum if hashing enabled

Duplicate file creation → halt.

---

# 9. Structural Drift Correction Rules

If drift detected and authorized:

Backfill may:

- Restore missing required file
- Regenerate schema
- Restore required directory

Backfill MUST NOT delete files.
Deletion requires separate decision cycle.

---

# 10. Fail-Closed Conditions

Backfill MUST halt if:

- Attempted modification of existing file
- Attempted overwrite detected
- Target path outside authorized namespace
- Unapproved action detected
- Template missing

Upon halt:

- artifacts/backfill/backfill_error.md MUST be generated
- System enters BLOCKED
- Exactly ONE blocking question must be produced

---

# 11. Downstream Invalidation Rule

If Backfill creates files:

Invalidate:

- execute/
- closure/

Trace and Gap remain valid unless structural mapping changed.

If structural change affects mapping → Trace must re-run.

---

# 12. No-Code Modification Clause

Backfill MUST NOT:

- Modify code/src/
- Edit existing governance docs
- Alter progress/status.json
- Rewrite artifacts produced earlier

Backfill is additive-only.

---

# 13. Completion Criteria

Backfill is COMPLETE only when:

- backfill_plan.json exists
- execution_log exists
- created_files.json exists (if applicable)
- No halt condition triggered
- All approved actions executed exactly once

Only then may Execute Module begin.

---

# 14. Governance Integrity Statement

Backfill protects the system from premature code manipulation.

Structural completeness must precede functional implementation.

No code change may occur before structural gaps are resolved.
