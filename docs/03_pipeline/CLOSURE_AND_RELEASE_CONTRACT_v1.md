# CLOSURE_AND_RELEASE_CONTRACT_v1

Document ID: DOC-37  
Status: EXECUTION-BOUND  
Authority Level: HARD (Fail-Closed)  
Applies To: SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM  
Governed By: MODULE_ORCHESTRATION_GOVERNANCE_v1  

---

# 1. Purpose

Closure Module finalizes a complete SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM execution cycle.

Its purpose is to:

- Re-verify structural integrity
- Confirm gap resolution
- Confirm decision compliance
- Confirm deterministic execution
- Generate immutable release snapshot

Closure is mandatory.
No execution cycle is valid without Closure.

---

# 2. Activation Preconditions

Closure may execute ONLY IF:

- Execute Module completed successfully
OR
- Gap reported zero gaps and auto-pass occurred
- No BLOCKED state active
- All upstream artifacts exist

If any condition fails → halt immediately.

---

# 3. Mandatory Re-Verification Sequence

Closure MUST re-run in this strict order:

1) Audit verification check  
2) Trace verification check  
3) Gap verification check  

Rules:

- Gap must equal zero
- No CRITICAL violations allowed
- No orphan_code_units allowed
- No orphan_requirements allowed
- No orphan_artifacts allowed

If any violation remains → halt.

---

# 4. Deterministic Validation Rules

Closure MUST verify:

- intake_snapshot.locked_snapshot_flag == true
- All required artifacts exist
- All artifact namespaces valid
- All decision files immutable
- No post-decision modification detected

Hash comparison MUST be performed if release snapshot exists.

---

# 5. Release Artifacts (Mandatory)

Closure MUST generate:

1) artifacts/closure/closure_report.md  
2) artifacts/release/RELEASE_MANIFEST_v1.json  
3) artifacts/release/repository_hash_snapshot.json  

If integrity tool exists, its output MUST be referenced.

---

# 6. RELEASE_MANIFEST_v1.json Schema

{
  "execution_id": "",
  "release_timestamp": "",
  "modules_executed": [
    "Intake",
    "Audit",
    "Trace",
    "Gap",
    "Decision",
    "Backfill",
    "Execute",
    "Closure"
  ],
  "gap_count": 0,
  "critical_violations": 0,
  "snapshot_hash": "",
  "deterministic_confirmation": true
}

---

# 7. repository_hash_snapshot.json Schema

{
  "execution_id": "",
  "total_files": 0,
  "repository_hash": "",
  "hash_algorithm": "",
  "captured_at": ""
}

Hash must be deterministic.

---

# 8. Immutability Lock

After Closure:

- All artifacts become immutable
- Governance docs must not change
- Any modification requires new execution cycle
- progress/status.json must update to reflect stable state

Silent modification is forbidden.

---

# 9. Stage Synchronization Rule

If Closure completes successfully:

System MAY:

- Update stage_progress_percent to 100
- Update next_step accordingly
- Mark execution cycle as CLOSED

If stage already D and 100%:

Closure must confirm no regression.

---

# 10. Fail-Closed Conditions

Closure MUST halt if:

- Any gap remains
- Any CRITICAL violation detected
- Any orphan entity exists
- Any required artifact missing
- Any decision file modified
- Hash mismatch detected

Upon halt:

- artifacts/closure/closure_error.md MUST be generated
- System enters BLOCKED
- Exactly ONE blocking question must be produced

---

# 11. No Silent Pass Rule

Closure MUST NOT:

- Ignore minor mismatches
- Downgrade severity
- Auto-fix errors
- Continue despite violation

All integrity must be explicitly satisfied.

---

# 12. Deterministic Snapshot Law

Given identical repository state:

Closure MUST produce identical:

- Release manifest
- Repository hash
- Closure report

No environment-specific variation allowed.

---

# 13. Completion Criteria

Closure is COMPLETE only when:

- closure_report.md exists
- RELEASE_MANIFEST_v1.json exists
- repository_hash_snapshot.json exists
- gap_count == 0
- critical_violations == 0
- deterministic_confirmation == true

Only then is execution cycle valid.

---

# 14. Governance Integrity Statement

Closure guarantees:

- Full system integrity
- Zero unresolved gaps
- Zero structural ambiguity
- Deterministic reproducibility
- Immutable release state

Without Closure, execution is provisional.

With Closure, execution becomes authoritative.
