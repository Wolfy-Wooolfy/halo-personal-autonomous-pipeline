# Audit Fail-Closed Halt

- execution_id: EXEC-724563529367
- reason: CRITICAL Artifact Namespace Integrity violations

SYSTEM STATE: BLOCKED

Blocking Question (SINGLE):
Do you authorize extending the allowed artifact namespaces for SELF_BUILDING_SYSTEM to include legacy namespaces (tasks, stage_C, reports, release) as "GRANDFATHERED / IMMUTABLE-LEGACY", so Audit can pass without requiring deletion or relocation?
