# Audit Fail-Closed Halt

- execution_id: EXEC-5DF395C207B1
- reason: CRITICAL Artifact Namespace Integrity violations (legacy namespaces present)

SYSTEM STATE: BLOCKED

Blocking Question (SINGLE):
Do you authorize "IMMUTABLE-LEGACY GRANDFATHERING" for existing namespaces:
artifacts/tasks/, artifacts/stage_A/, artifacts/stage_B/, artifacts/stage_C/, artifacts/stage_D/, artifacts/reports/, and their existing historical naming references,
while enforcing the new module namespaces (intake/audit/trace/gap/decisions/backfill/execute/closure/release) for all NEW artifacts going forward?
