# Stage C — Code Mismatch Report

**Artifact Type:** Stage C Evidence  
**Stage:** C  
**Generated By:** TASK-033 / TASK-034  
**Status:** PARTIAL — BLOCKING (Trace gaps remain)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16

---

## Summary

This report records mismatches between **Stage B documented requirements** and the **current Stage C code state**, including verification coverage.

**Key result:**
- Deterministic verification evidence exists and is **PASS**.
- Clause-level trace mapping from Stage B → code is **NOT yet complete**.
- Stage C cannot be closed until clause-level mapping resolves MM-TRACE-001.

## Mismatch Index

### MM-TRACE-001 (MUST) — TRACE_GAP (OPEN)
**Type:** Traceability Gap  
**Severity:** MUST  
**Status:** OPEN (BLOCKING)

**Problem:**  
`artifacts/stage_C/code_trace_matrix.md` currently provides mapping coverage for Stage C outputs, but does **not** provide **clause-level mapping** from Stage B requirements (by clause/ID) to concrete code locations.

**Required Fix (Stage C):**
- Extend trace matrix to include:
  - Stage B clause IDs (or stable clause anchors)
  - Explicit mapping to code file paths + functions/modules
  - Evidence links to tests/verification where applicable

**Blocking:** YES

---

### MM-VERIF-001 (MUST) — VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE (RESOLVED)
**Type:** Verification Evidence  
**Severity:** MUST  
**Status:** RESOLVED

**Problem:**  
Stage C must provide deterministic verification evidence.

**Resolution Evidence:**  
- `artifacts/stage_C/test_evidence.md` exists and records deterministic verification as **PASSED**, including pre-run checks.

**Blocking:** NO

---

## Resolution State

- **unresolved_total:** 1  
- **resolved_total:** 1  
- **blocking:** true

---

## Next Required Step

**Stage C — Execute TASK-035 handler** to extend trace matrix to **clause-level** mapping and resolve **MM-TRACE-001**.
